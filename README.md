# Face-detection-using-Haar-Cascade
A real time face detection model to detect people wearing mask and not wearing them. Haar Cascade algorithm, a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video and based on the concept of features proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images. Since these images are very less in number, we cannot train a neural network from scratch. Instead, we finetune a pre-trained network called MobileNetV2 which is trained on the Imagenet dataset. Since in Google Colab web cam cannot be accessed, javascript code to open webcam is imported.
